                Founded in South Africa and based between Amsterdam and Cape Town, creative duo Anna Thomas and Kim
                Verburg merge their expertise in carpentry and architecture to create furniture that is both functional
                and playful. Currently, Thomas & Verburg have a strong focus on benches – thoughtfully produced in small
                batches using locally sourced wood. However, this is just the beginning. Our vision is to grow into a
                broader design space, exploring new forms, materials, and ideas that push the boundaries of contemporary
                furniture. Follow along as we evolve and grow!

                Our benches are made in small, carefully considered batches using locally harvested wood sourced in
                South Africa. Crafted by skilled small-scale carpenters, each piece reflects quality, craftsmanship, and
                sustainability. Since we work with the wood we have on hand, availability may vary. While we strive to
                keep stock of our collections as displayed online, we cannot always guarantee immediate availability. To
                check current stock, please email us — we'd be happy to assist! You can also sign up for our newsletter
                to be the first to know when new stock becomes available. For any other inquiries, feel free to get in
                touch. We'd love to hear from you.
